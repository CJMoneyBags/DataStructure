# Queue

## Introduction to the Queue data structure
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out manner. This is just like the lines we are all used to being in for things like the store, to buy a ticket, or to even take your turn at the drinking fountain.

There is a person in the 'Front' of the queue and then another person lines up behind him and so forth. When the person in front is served that is called a **Dequeue** and when someone goes into the line that is called **Enqueue**. A queue will also have functions to tell if it is **Empty** or the **Size** of the queue.
